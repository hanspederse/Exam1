<h3>Fact Worth Sharing</h3>
<p>The Wright brothers' airplane Flyer 1 began the era of powered flight when it flew in 1903. A tiny swatch of fabric from that airplane is now attached to the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars, ushering in a new era of flight.</p>
<p>Ingenuity, the small drone onboard NASA's Perseverance rover, unpacked itself from the belly of its rover this week, a complicated process that took several days. Next, Perseverance will drive away to allow Ingenuity’s solar batteries to charge before the drone makes its first flight test. If Ingenuity succeeds, it will have performed the first powered, controlled flight on another planet.</p>

    <h2>A NASA mission to Venus in 1978 may have detected phosphine</h2>
    <p>A group of scientists say that 43-year-old data from NASA’s Pioneer Venus Multiprobe mission, which deployed a series of probes into the planet’s clouds, may indicate the presence of phosphine and other gases linked to life in Venus’ atmosphere. The findings add to the spirited debate over whether another team of scientists detected phosphine during ground-based telescopic observations in 2017 and 2019, a discovery that has been questioned by other scientists.

    <h2>Earth is safe from asteroid Apophis for at least the next 100 years.</h2>
    <p>The notorious 450-meter-wide space rock will come closer than geostationary communications satellites in 2029. It previously had a 1-in-150,000 chance of hitting Earth in 2068; radar observations taken during the asteroid’s 5 March flyby have now ruled that out.

<div class="introduction" style="background-color: #00203fff;">
  <h1 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; padding: 22px 0px 10px;"><u>Imagine You're an Astronaut</u></h1>
  <p style="color: #fff;">Astronauts on the International Space Station, or ISS, often spend six to 12 months in space, orbiting Earth. It can be a little cramped staying inside the space station all that time. Astronauts still need to do their everyday living, such as working, eating, relaxing and exercising, but with fewer resources than they have on Earth.</p>
  <p style="color: #fff;">Imagine you and your family are astronauts on the space station right now. You can only use the resources available to you. How would you adapt to the challenges and still keep doing important routines, like exercising, learning and making time for fun?</p>
  
  <br>
  
  <h3 style="color: #fff;">1. Keep learning</h3>
  <p style="color: #fff;">Astronauts are constantly learning. They do all the science experiments that need to happen on the space station. Most of the time, these experiments were designed by someone else, so astronauts need to learn about the science they are doing to follow the right steps and share the results. Astronauts also need to learn how to operate parts of the space station, such as the robotic arm.</p>
  
  <h3 style="color: #fff;">2. Exercise</h3>
  <p style="color: #fff;">Astronauts need to keep their muscles strong when they’re in space. One way they do this is by running on a treadmill. The treadmill has bungee cords that hold the astronauts down so they don’t float away. You can keep your muscles strong, too. Do some jumping jacks, pushups, situps, or walk and jog in place so that you’ll be strong enough when you can go exploring.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #fff;">3. Observe Earth</h3>
  <p style="color: #fff;">Astronauts love to take pictures and videos of Earth from the window of the space station. Seeing Earth in new ways gets them thinking about what makes our planet unique and special. You can take pictures from your window, too. Think about what makes your street, neighborhood or city unique and take note of the patterns you see. How are the trees and plants changing from day to day? How do the shapes and colors of the clouds change? (Identify what kinds of clouds they are and make a cloud mobile.) Do you see birds, squirrels or other creatures? What do you notice about them?</p>
